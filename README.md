> Ada binding to WebDriver API

[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)
is a remote control interface that enables introspection and
control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire
protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the
behavior of web browsers.

This project is an Ada library to work WebDriver. Currently it's been
tested with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

```
